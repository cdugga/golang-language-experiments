max subarray problem consists in finding the maximum sum of a contiguous subsequence in an array or list of integers

maxSequence[-2,1,-3, 4,-1,2,1,-5,4] => 4+(-1)+2+1+(-5)+5=6

maxSequence[-2,-3,4,-1,-2,1,5,3] => 4 +(-1)+(-2)+1+5=7

1) if list is all N (positive integers) then sum is sum of entire array
2) if list is Z- (negative numbers) than return 0
3) Empty list considered to have zero greatest sum, return 0
4) Empty list considered valid sublist/subarrary
