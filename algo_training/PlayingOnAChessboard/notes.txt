In other words a fraction a/b is irreducible if and only if a and b are coprime ( both have largest common divisor of 1)


Map out fractions across n rows of a chesstable. Each row is n columns wide and n rows
long

Rows follow convention whereby:

var sum
for i := 1; i <=n; i++
    for each row need to iterate through each column and sum
    for j := 1; j <= n; j++
        sum += i/j

row1 starts with 1/n+1 2/3 3/4 4/5 5/6 ..
row2 starts wth  1/n+2 2/
row3 starts wth  1/n+3
rown starts wth  1/n+n
